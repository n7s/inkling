# Inkling
A simple stand-alone webapp to showcase the beautiful letters of a font. It uses `opentype.js` and does not require an active connection. Any fonts will stay local and not be uploaded to a server. 

## License
Like the `opentype.js` `unicode-name.js` this software is licensed under the MIT license.

## How to use Inkling 
Just open the HTML page in a browser like Firefox then drag-and-drop a font on it. It will read TTF, OTF and WOFF file formats, both static and variable.

You can adjust the speed of animation, the size and position of the letter.
By default, the font metadata as well as the glyph information, including the full unicode name for the given character, are displayed for 2 seconds per letter. 

Bringing your mouse towards the lower portion of the screen will reveal the config panel where you can tweak the defaults and learn the shortcuts.
