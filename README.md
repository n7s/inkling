# Inkling
A simple stand-alone webapp to showcase the beautiful letters of a font. Just a hint of the various letterforms that typeface designers and script engineers have built together. See the [definition of inkling](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inkling). It uses `opentype.js` and does not require an active connection. Any fonts will stay local and not be uploaded to a server.

## How to use Inkling
Just open the <a href="https://n7s.github.io/inkling/http_root/" target="_blank"> Inkling main HTML page</a> in a browser like <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a> then drag-and-drop a font file on it. It will read TTF, OTF and WOFF file formats.

You can adjust the speed of animation, the size and position of the letter.
By default, the font metadata as well as the glyph information, including the full unicode name for the given character, are displayed for 2 seconds per letter. 

Bringing your mouse towards the lower portion of the screen will reveal the config panel where you can tweak the defaults and learn the shortcuts.
